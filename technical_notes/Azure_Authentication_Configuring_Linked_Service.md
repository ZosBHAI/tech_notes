# Authentication in Azure
#Azure #Concept 
## Authentication Methods
- **Account Key**: Similar to Access Key in AWS.
- **Azure Key Vault**: Securely store and manage secrets, keys, and certificates.
- **Service Principal**: 
  - Acts as an identity created for an application to access resources.
  - Uses **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for authentication.
- **Managed Identity**: Built-in identity for Azure services to authenticate without storing secrets.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
  - Example Role: **Contributor**
