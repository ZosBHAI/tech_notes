# Local Datasets vs. Shared Datasets

## Introduction
  In organizations, multiple departments often use the same data for reporting and analysis. Without a centralized approach, this leads to data duplication, confusion about data sources, and inefficiency.  
  Power BI resolves this through **datasets**, enabling centralized, reusable data models for consistent and accurate reporting.

## Datasets in Power BI
  A **dataset** is a curated data model used as a single source of truth for reports and dashboards.  

### Key Features
- **Build Permission:** Controls who can create content or access the dataset in or outside Power BI (e.g., Excel).  
- **Endorsements:**
- **Promoted:** Shared broadly for general use.  
- **Certified:** Formally approved, ensuring data quality and governance.  
- **Power BI Data Hub:** Enables dataset discovery and reuse across workspaces, fostering a collaborative data culture.
### Conclusion
- **Local Datasets** are ideal for smaller teams or projects needing high security and speed.  
- **Shared Datasets** suit larger organizations emphasizing collaboration, consistency, and scalability.  
- The choice between them depends on organizational size, security needs, and collaboration requirements.
